3. Open the PPTX and familiarize yourself with slides
4. Test ProtonPulse running on your computer
5. Load sample data and practice the demo

### Step 2: Practice (1 hour)
1. Do a full run-through presentation
2. Time yourself (aim for ~40 min, leaves 10 for Q&A)
3. Practice the demo multiple times
4. Note any sections that feel rushed
5. Refine your delivery

### Step 3: Prepare Environment (30 minutes before)
1. Open PPTX and start on title slide
2. Have ProtonPulse running in background
3. Load sample data into app (ready to compute)
4. Have SPEAKER_NOTES.md or QUICK_REFERENCE.md visible
5. Test projector with your laptop
6. Take a breath—you've got this!

### Step 4: Present (45-50 minutes)
1. Go through slides at a steady pace
2. Use SPEAKER_NOTES as reference
3. When you reach Slide 11, do the live demo

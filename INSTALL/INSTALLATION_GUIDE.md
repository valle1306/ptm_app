## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "PowerShell cannot be opened"

**Solution:**
1. Right-click Windows PowerShell on Start menu
2. Select **Run as administrator**
3. Navigate to ProtonPulse folder:
   ```powershell
   cd C:\Path\To\ProtonPulse
   ```
4. Run setup:

   ```

---

### Problem: "Python not found" when running app

**Solution:**
- You skipped Step 2 (Install Dependencies)
- Double-click `setup_env.ps1` and let it finish
- Then try the shortcut again

---

### Problem: App opens but shows "Connection refused"

**Solution:**
1. Close the browser and the terminal
2. Wait 5 seconds
3. Double-click the ProtonPulse shortcut again
4. Wait for the terminal to say "You can now view..."

---

### Problem: CSV upload fails

**Solution:**
- Make sure your CSV has these columns (exactly):
  - `Site_ID` - name of your PTM site
  - `Copies` - how many times this site appears
  - `P(-2)`, `P(-1)`, `P(0)`, `P(+1)`, `P(+2)` - probabilities
  
- Download the template from the app to see the correct format
- Save as `.csv` (not `.xlsx` or `.xls`)

---

### Problem: "Port 8501 is already in use"

**Solution:**
1. Close any other ProtonPulse windows or terminals
2. Open Task Manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc)
3. Find "python.exe" in the list
4. Right-click → End Task
5. Try launching again

---

## 💾 Where Does My Data Go?

- **Uploaded CSVs**: Only stored in your browser (cleared when you close)
- **Downloaded results**: Go to your Downloads folder
- **Local computer**: Your computer stores nothing permanently
- **Cloud**: Your files are NOT uploaded anywhere

**Your data is always private and under your control.**

## 🔄 Updating ProtonPulse

If a new version is released:

1. Download the new `ProtonPulse_Setup.zip`
2. Extract to a **different folder** (e.g., `ProtonPulse_v2.4`)
3. Run `setup_env.ps1` in the new folder
4. Update your desktop shortcut to point to the new folder

---

## ⚡ Advanced Usage (For Power Users)

### Run from Terminal

If you prefer the command line:

```powershell
cd C:\Path\To\ProtonPulse
.\run_protonpulse.bat
```

Or with PowerShell:

```powershell
cd C:\Path\To\ProtonPulse
.\run_protonpulse.ps1
```

### Command-Line Flags

If you want to customize the app:

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m streamlit run ptm_charge_input_v2.py `
    --server.port 9000 `
    --server.headless false
